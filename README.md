# CORE-HIDS
Overview

CORE-HIDS is a research-oriented Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) designed to monitor system behavior and detect anomalies.

It is modular and flexible, separating event acquisition, analysis, alerting, and persistence, making it easy to extend and integrate new detection techniques based on rules, statistics, or machine learning.

CORE-HIDS serves as both a practical monitoring solution and a research platform for studying host-based threat detection and automated security response.

Architecture

## CORE-HIDS follows a modular pipeline:

Event Acquisition → Analysis → Alert Generation → Logging & Persistence → Concurrent Processing

log_monitor.py – real-time host event acquisition

detector.py – orchestrates the detection workflow

baseline.py – behavioral profiling for anomaly detection

alerts.py – manages alert generation and notifications

persistence.py – stores data and system telemetry

worker.py – supports parallel execution for high performance

## Installation
